# Login-web-page
first met by loggin web page, transition to main web page.
The main purpose of this project is to show how powerful css can be for making animations with html elements.
Putting more emphasis on the login web page, main web page is left blank. 
Will need all three index.html, login.html, and style.css to run this.
